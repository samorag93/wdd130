    <p>Hi everyone, here something about me. I live in Madrid Spain but I was born in Equator 
        in a town called otavalo where some people say it's a laminate town.</p>
     <p>I served in the Ecuador Guayaquil south mission since 2017 to 2019 after my mission 
        I meet a great young woman which the Lord promised me send to my life. After some months 
        as a couple I asked her to marry me, and she accepted. We get married during the pandemic 
        on july 2020 and we were sealed for time and eternity on february 2022. The next month we 
        received a amazing news. My wife was pregnant with twins. Now they are 4 months old, their 
        names are Santiago and Memphis.</p>
        
    <p>My passion is tecnology so I try to learn more of it. Another hobby is read old books of the 
        church. I like fitness life too. My favorites songs are rock and roll and hip hop.</p>
        
    <p>This is something about me if you want to know more about me, ask me without fear.</p>
